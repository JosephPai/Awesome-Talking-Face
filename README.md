# Awesome Talking Face [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#readme)

This is a repository for organizing papres, codes and other resources related to talking face/head. Most papers are linked to the pdf address provided by "arXiv" or "OpenAccess". However, some papers require an academic license to browse. For example, IEEE, springer, and elsevier journal, etc.



#### :high_brightness: This project is still on-going, pull requests are welcomed!!

If you have any suggestions (missing papers, new papers, key researchers or typos), please feel free to edit and pull a request. Just letting me know the title of papers can also be a big contribution to me. You can do this by open issue or contact me directly via email.



#### :star: If you find this repo useful, please star it!!!


#### 2022.09 Update!
Thanks for PR from everybody! From now on, I'll occasionally include some papers about **video-driven** talking face generation. Because I found that the community is trying to include the **video-driven** methods into the talking face generation scope, though it is originally termed as **Face Reenactment**.

So, if you are looking for **video-driven talking face generation**, I would suggest you have a star here, and go to search Face Reenactment, you'll find more :)

One more thing, please correct me if you find that there are any paper noted as arXiv paper has been accepted to some conferences or journals.


#### 2021.11 Update!

I updated a batch of papers that appeared in the past few months. In this repo, I was intend to cover the **audio-driven** talking face generation works. However, I found several **text-based** research works are also very interesting. So I included them here. Enjoy it!
